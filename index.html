<p> <center> There seemed to be a series of chraracters who were considered important to the plot. The main protagonist looked to be a man, along with what we hypothecially believe to be the main antagonist, a lady with fashionably bright and flamboyant outfit, to what we think the filmmakers saw how the future would look. From what we could find, there were sketches of the ideas of what the characters and what seems to be a hideout could have looked like in the movie. The directors used a bunch of illustrations to find ideas for their work instead of wrtiting it down. And with this creativity, there was also a rumor stating that the set was going to be built completely rather than having a green screen or using real locations.

<p><center><u><h3>"Tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation: 'Joh Fredersen, where is my son-!'"</p></center></u></h3>

<p>Metropolis 1927 was a German expressionist science fiction film directed by Fritz Lang, along with actors Gustav Fr√∂hlich, Alfred Abel, and Brigitte Helms as the main cast. The movie is inspired by the novel "Metropolis" by von Harbou. Some comparisons we see with the Metropolis' is that they are both silent films, however with 1927 they have parts that show the script, and with 2005 there is no dialouge at all. Another comparison are the main casts with Ferder and Maria, and the main protagonist and the idol, with similar stories and motives with the plot. The last comparison is classism being a huge play point when it comes to the films, fighting with the upper and lower class. However some constrasts is that 1927 is a black and white film, and 2005 is a colored film. Another contrast with the movies is that 2005 has a knit tight group of rebels while 1927 has two main characters, besides the entire lower class. The last constrast would be the intensity of the upper and lower class, we rarely see the upper class in Metropolis since the lovebirds are a subplot in the film, but from what we have discovered, the 2005 film would have gone more in depth about the world surrounding them and the two social classes that lived in Metropolis. And another fun fact would be the music, apparantly with 1927, there was only one orchestrated song the entire film, while 2005 was supposed to gain an entirse OST, with one being the main theme, and yes the song did have lyrics.</p>

<h2><center> The Mysterious Disappearance of Rhapsody in Metropolis </center></h2>
<p> The film itself, similar to Metropolis, was to be set in the future around the 3000's in terms of years, more than 80 decades later. The film Rhapsody in Metropolis was supposed to be released in theaters 2005, but all of a sudden it was taken off the roster of films being released in June 2005, and was never heard from again. Along with the supposed filmmakers who were directing it were unheard from. Trying to reach out to actors only to find out they were not professional actors, but rather everyday people who have auditioned for their roles, like what film director Abbas Kiarostami had done for his films "Where is Friend's house" and "Life, and Nothing More..."</p>
	<p>When we had looked for said actors, we also found they were from multiple parts of the world such as Eastern Europe, Central America, North America, South Asia, Australia, North Africa, and East Asia. Some of the actors were impossible to find, considering when we did this project, most of them are much older now with families and jobs, however we did find one of the main protagonists who served as what the poster makes her look like some sort or celebrity or idol of the upper class. We set up an interview with her September 27, 2018, and she wanted her identity to remain anonymous.
		The interview went smoothly despite her constant wants of her children, but we could see why she fit perfectly in her role for the film with her strength and demeanor, handling everything with grace and poise, composing herself as she told her children to wait in their rooms as we interviewed her. 
</p>

<p> "Ah 'Rhapsody in Metropolis,'" she spoke as she sipped a cup of water. She had recalled working with everyone, auditioning in it as a teenager and being given the role as the idol. She had said her character was a revoluitonaire, a fighter in a sense who came from the bottom to the top, now wanting to help those who are at the bottom as well. When we had asked about the film's disappearance, she had frowned and responded delicately. "The film never really disappeared, it is accessible but you will have to find someone who owns the films, in any case it would be the actors or the rest of the people who worked on the film. Some decided not to keep the film and I know one person who decided to keep it as a memorial, digging it in his backyard as to keep it hidden, like a time capsule of sorts. When we were told that the film wouldn't be in theaters, the actors were shocked, only the people who worked behind the screen seemed upset since film work was their career, unlike the actors who had seperate jobs and lives. The directors had told us that the world wasn't ready to experience this film yet, it would cause distress to most, so everyone reluctantly agreed and were gifted VHS tapes of the completed film." </p>
